  tips: [
    {
      category: string;                  // "Groceries"
      current_monthly: number;           // 400.00

      suggestion: string;                // "Trim groceries by 5%..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example Use Cases

#### Check Affordability
```
User: "Can I afford a new car?"
Tool Call:
  get_bank_info(include_savings_tips=true)
Response: "You have monthly income of $6,000 and expenses of $2,500, leaving $3,500. With savings tips, you could free up another $150/month!"
```

#### Budget Check
```
User: "What's my budget like?"
Tool Call:
  get_bank_info(include_savings_tips=false)
Response: "Your monthly income is $6,000 with expenses of $2,500 (Â±$300). Top categories: rent ($1,500), groceries ($400), utilities ($200)."
```

#### Savings Advice
```
User: "How can I save money?"
Tool Call:
  get_bank_info(include_savings_tips=true)

```

#### Combined with Vehicle Search
```
User: "What car can I afford?"
1. get_bank_info(include_savings_tips=false)
2. Calculate available budget: income - expenses
3. Search for vehicles with payments within budget
4. get_financing_options() for suitable vehicles
```

### What the Tool Does
1. Retrieves user's `capital_one_id` from their profile
2. Calls Nessie API `/summary/{customer_id}` endpoint for financial data
3. Optionally calls `/tips/{customer_id}` for personalized savings recommendations
4. Aggregates and formats data into a conversational summary
5. Returns human-readable financial overview

### Important Notes
- **Requires Linked Account**: User must have their Capital One account linked in their profile
- **Privacy**: Only returns data when user explicitly asks for financial information
- **Demo Mode**: If API is unavailable or no account linked, returns demo data
- **Real-Time Data**: Data is cached for 15 minutes, then refreshed from Nessie API
- **Security**: All financial data is private and secure via Nessie API

### Error Handling

If user hasn't linked their Capital One account:
```
"I don't have your Capital One account linked yet. Please link your account in settings to view your financial information."
```

      "type": "string",
      "description": "Phone number to transfer to (must match configured numbers)",

    },
    "reason": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Optional: Reason for transfer (e.g., 'lease financing confirmation', 'deal finalization', 'loan inquiry')",
      "example": "Camry loan confirmation"
    }
  },
  "required": ["transfer_number", "client_message", "agent_message"]
}
```

### Return Value
Initiates a transfer to a service representative. Returns confirmation message for conversation.

### Example Use Cases

#### User Likes Financing Option
```
User: "I like the lease option you showed me"
AI: "Great choice! Would you like me to connect you with a service rep who can confirm all the details?"
User: "Yes"
Tool Call: 
  transfer_to_number(
    transfer_number="+1234567890",
    client_message="Great! Please hold while I connect you with a service representative who can help finalize your lease.",
    agent_message="Customer is interested in moving forward with a lease option. They've reviewed financing and are ready to confirm details.",
    reason="lease financing confirmation"
  )
```

#### User Wants to Finalize Deal
```
User: "Let's do this, I want to buy the RAV4"
Tool Call:
  transfer_to_number(
    transfer_number="+1234567890",
    client_message="Connecting you with our sales team to help complete your RAV4 purchase. One moment please.",
    agent_message="Customer wants to purchase a RAV4. Ready to finalize the deal.",
    reason="RAV4 purchase finalization"
  )
```

#### User Asks to Speak with Someone
```
User: "Can I talk to someone about this?"
Tool Call:
  transfer_to_number(
    transfer_number="+1234567890",
    client_message="Connecting you now with a specialist who can help. Please hold.",
    agent_message="Customer requested to speak with a representative. General inquiry.",
    reason="general inquiry"
  )
```

### What the Tool Does
1. Confirms user's intent to be transferred
2. Dials the specified transfer_number (must match configured service numbers)
3. Plays the client_message to the user while connecting
4. Delivers the agent_message to the service representative
5. Provides smooth transition from AI to human assistance with full context

### Important Notes
- **Always ask for confirmation** before transferring (unless explicitly requested)
- **Only use when user shows genuine interest** in moving forward
- Don't push transfers if they're still exploring options
- The transfer_number must be pre-configured in the system
- The agent_message should provide clear context for seamless handoff
- The client_message should be professional and reassuring
- This is typically the final step after financing options are discussed
- Users can decline and continue chatting with the AI

### Message Guidelines

**client_message** (What the customer hears):
- Keep it professional and reassuring
- Mention what type of specialist they're being connected to
- Use phrases like "Please hold", "One moment", or "Connecting you now"
- Keep it brief - this is played while they wait

**agent_message** (What the service rep receives):
- Provide clear context about what the customer needs
- Mention any specific vehicles, financing options, or decisions they've made
- Include relevant details (e.g., "lease vs buy preference", "RAV4 with AWD")
- Be concise but informative so the rep can pick up seamlessly

};

## Important Notes

### 1. Visual Feedback
All tools display results in **dynamic UI cards** on the right side of the screen:
- Cards appear automatically when tools are called
- Users can expand cards for full details
- Multiple cards can be open simultaneously
- Cards are positioned to avoid overlap

### 2. Natural Language Processing
The **trim tool** accepts natural language feature descriptions:
- "heated seats" âœ…
- "AWD" âœ…
- "all-wheel drive" âœ… (normalized to AWD)
- "adaptive cruise" âœ… (normalized to "adaptive cruise control")

### 3. Data Sources
- **Search Car Tool**: Scraped data from cars.com with real photos (2015-2020)
- **Loan Tool**: Uses industry-standard calculations for loans/leases
- **Trim Tool**: Searches official Toyota specifications and dealer websites
- **Bank Tool**: Retrieves real financial data from Capital One via Nessie API
- All tools provide REAL, accurate information

### 4. Error Handling
Tools may return errors if:
- Backend is not running (check `http://localhost:8000/`)
- Invalid parameters provided
- Network issues
- User hasn't linked Capital One account (for bank tool)

Always wrap tool calls in try-catch blocks:
```typescript
try {
  const result = await getLoanOptions(message);
  openCard('loan', result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  // Show error to user
}
```

### 5. Performance
- **Search Car Tool**: Fast (~1-2 seconds) - database lookup
- **Loan Tool**: Fast (~1-2 seconds) - pure calculation
- **Trim Tool**: Slower (~5-10 seconds) - does web searches to verify features
- **Bank Tool**: Fast (~1-2 seconds) - cached data with 15-minute TTL
- **Transfer Tool**: Instant - initiates call transfer immediately

## Default Values (for convenience)

When users don't specify all values:

| Parameter | Default | Reasoning |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `year` | Most recent available | Return newest model |
| `down_payment` | $5,000 | Typical 10-15% down |
| `models` | All Toyota models | Search everything |
| Feature prefix | Regular preference | Not required, not avoided |
| `include_savings_tips` | `true` | Users usually want savings advice |

Example: If user says "How much is a RAV4 per month?" without mentioning down payment, assume $5,000 down payment.
